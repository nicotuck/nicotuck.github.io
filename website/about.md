Hello there! My name is Nick, and I'm the creator and author behind this blog. 

I've dedicated this personal blog to the realms of machines, coding, and fun on two wheels. As an engineer, I have gained extensive experience in various engineering disciplines, ranging from mechanical and system engineering to software development, and hope to share some of that here.

I'm also using this platform as a learning tool - I am new to frontend development, so expect lots of questionable design choices, broken things, and rapid changes.
