title: "Machines, Code, and Bikes"

This is my personal space to merge my interests in machines, code, and bikes. It's a platform where I share some of my experiences, knowledge, and insights, while also sharing my learning process on new topics. Whether you're an engineer, a bike aficionado, or simply someone with a curious mind, this blog offers something for you!
